**Note:** This blog post's been updated with `signal`'s new usage in Wash 0.15.0.

Wash 0.13.0 includes a new `signal` command that lets you send an arbitrary signal to a given entry. For example, you can use `signal` to start a stopped container.

```
wash . ❯ meta docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
...
State:
  Dead: false
  Error: ""
  ExitCode: 0
  FinishedAt: "2019-11-16T18:58:03.7284542Z"
  OOMKilled: false
  Paused: false
  Pid: 0
  Restarting: false
  Running: false
  StartedAt: "2019-11-12T21:47:13.9406019Z"
  Status: exited
wash . ❯ signal start docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
wash . ❯ meta docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
...
State:
  Dead: false
  Error: ""
  ExitCode: 0
  FinishedAt: "2019-11-16T18:58:03.7284542Z"
  OOMKilled: false
  Paused: false
  Pid: 63392
  Restarting: false
  Running: true
  StartedAt: "2019-11-16T18:58:49.6323676Z"
  Status: running
```

If the entry's schema is known, then you can use the `docs` command to view its supported signals/signal groups.

```
wash . ❯ docs docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
No description provided.

SUPPORTED SIGNALS
* start
    Starts the container. Equivalent to 'docker start <container>'
* stop
    Stops the container. Equivalent to 'docker stop <container>'
* pause
    Suspends all processes in the container. Equivalent to 'docker pause <container>'
* resume
    Un-suspends all processes in the container. Equivalent to 'docker unpause <container>'
* restart
    Restarts the container. Equivalent to 'docker restart <container>'

SUPPORTED SIGNAL GROUPS
* linux
    Consists of all the supported Linux signals like SIGHUP, SIGKILL. Equivalent to
    'docker kill <container> --signal <signal>'
```

> Note that signal groups consist of signals that fall under a specific category.

`signal` currently works with Docker containers, AWS EC2 instances, and GCP compute instances (try it out!).
 
**For plugin authors:** You can get `signal` to work with other entries by implementing the `signal` action (see [here]({{ 'docs/external-plugins#signal' | relative_url }}) for external plugins, [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/puppetlabs/wash/plugin#Signalable) for core plugins). Checkout the corresponding entry schema docs to see how you'd specify an entry's supported signals. Note that the `signal` action does _not_ have to wait for the given signal operation to finish. It is enough to return once the signal's been successfully received by the plugin's API. We also don't impose any restrictions on the sent signal's name, so you are free to name your signals however way you want.

Note that we're open to extending the `signal` action's power depending on user demand. Some things we're considering are:

* Extending `signal` to take-in signal-specific API options. This would enable something like `signal stop docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1` to accept all of `docker stop`'s options. In a more general sense, this lets `signal` take full advantage of the plugin's API by allowing the user to pass-in API-specific options.

* Extending `signal` to return an (optional) result of the signaled operation. Combined with (1), this would enable `signal` to be the "kitchen-sink" Wash action, where plugin authors can specify all vendor-specific operations that are not captured by any of the other Wash actions as signals (similar to an arbitrary method invocation).

Please let us know if any of these extensions would be useful by filing an appropriate issue!
