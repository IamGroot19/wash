If you're not using Puppet Bolt, [check it out](https://puppetlabs.github.io/bolt/).

If you're using Bolt, then we created the [Boltwash](https://github.com/puppetlabs/boltwash) plugin that lets you navigate your inventory. Let's check it out
```
wash . > stree bolt
bolt
└── [group]
    └── [target]
        └── fs
```

## Exploring Boltwash

As you can see, the Bolt plugin organizes Bolt targets as groups. It also mounts something called `fs` (a view of the filesystem on that target). Let's explore it a bit more.
```
wash . > cd bolt
wash bolt > ls
all/
my-docker-app/
my-linux-nodes/
my-windows-nodes/
```

I have an inventory setup organizing some machines by where they run. Your groups would be organized however you like. The `all` group will appear for everyone, it contains all targets in your inventory (it's an implicit group that can be used in Bolt). Let's explore a particular target.
```
wash bolt > tree -L 2 my-linux-nodes
my-linux-nodes
├── node1
│   └── fs
└── node2
    └── fs
wash bolt > cd my-linux-nodes/node1/fs
wash bolt/my-linux-nodes/node1/fs > ls
bin/
boot/
dev/
etc/
home/
...
```

Great, I can see the files on that system, and I didn't have to do any additional setup. I can go look at config or watch logs
```
wash bolt/my-linux-nodes/node1/fs > cat etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
...
wash bolt/my-linux-nodes/node1/fs > tail -f var/log/syslog
Feb  7 18:39:51 pe-agent01 systemd[18116]: Startup finished in 23ms.
Feb  7 18:39:51 pe-agent01 systemd[1]: Started User Manager for UID 1000.
...
```

We can also explore Windows targets using WinRM
```
wash bolt/my-windows-nodes/node5/fs > cat Users
Administrator/
Public/
```

Boltwash includes target configuration as metadata, so you can also view that
```
wash bolt/my-linux-nodes > meta node1
alias: []
config:
  ssh:
    connect-timeout: 10
    disconnect-timeout: 5
    load-config: true
    run-as: root
    tty: false
    user: ubuntu
  transport: ssh
facts: {}
features: []
name: node1
plugin_hooks: {}
uri: node1
vars:
  datacenter: west coast
```
and use `find` to search for nodes based on that metadata
```
wash bolt > find . -meta .vars.datacenter 'west coast'
all/node1
all/node5
my-linux-nodes/node1
my-windows-nodes/node5
```

## Debugging with Bolt + Wash

Wash can be helpful debugging all sorts of failures. As an example, suppose you have a cluster of machines (in the `webservers` group) that are having problems
```
wash bolt/webservers > ls
server1/
server2/
server3/
```

You've noticed an issue in one of their logs, and want to see if it's present everywhere
```
wash bolt/webservers > grep OutOfMemory */fs/var/log/syslog
server1/fs/var/log/syslog:Jan 28 12:09:34 server1 my-server[435]: ...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError...
server2/fs/var/log/syslog:Jan 28 12:09:43 server2 my-server[435]: ...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError...
server3/fs/var/log/syslog:Jan 28 12:09:01 server3 my-server[435]: ...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError...
```

Seeing that they're all experiencing these issues, let's see where the server process is still running
```
wash bolt/webservers > wps * | grep bin/java
server1     9027   12:10.02   /usr/bin/java -Xmx2048m -cp /opt/my-server/server.jar ...
server2    21204   12:13.02   /usr/bin/java -Xmx2048m -cp /opt/my-server/server.jar ...
```

Looks like they've restarted recently, and the server's not running on `server3`. Let's reconfigure the servers to allow more memory (using Bolt or by directly modifying config/service files) and restart them
```
wash bolt/webservers > bolt task run service -t webservers action=restart name=my-server
Started on server1...
Started on server2...
Started on server3...
Finished on server1:
  {
    "status": "MainPID=751,LoadState=loaded,ActiveState=active"
  }
Finished on server2:
  {
    "status": "MainPID=2927,LoadState=loaded,ActiveState=active"
  }
Finished on server3:
  {
    "status": "MainPID=21936,LoadState=loaded,ActiveState=active"
  }
Successful on 3 targets: server1,server2,server3
Ran on 3 targets in 1.91 sec
```

You can imagine other scenarios as well. Suppose you ran a Bolt plan across several targets and want to get some files back from them. You can use Wash to directly copy them with something like
```
wash bolt > for f in group/*/fs/path/to/file; do cp -v "$f" ~/dest/"${f//\//_}"; done
```
> The Bash string manipulation (`${f//\//_}`) replaces all slashes in the original path to the file with underscores to make it unique.

## Configuring Boltwash

Boltwash loads the default Boltdir at `~/.puppetlabs/bolt`, but you can configure it to load any Boltdir in Wash's config. To use Boltwash, you add it to the `external-plugins` key in `~/.puppetlabs/wash/wash.yaml`; adding a custom Boltdir location looks like
```
external-plugins:
- script: '/path/to/boltwash/bolt.rb'
bolt:
  dir: /path/to/boltdir
```

The Bolt plugin for Wash provides an accessible, interactive means of investigating multiple systems. Combined with Bolt inventory, it's natural to then take action with Bolt. [Try it out!](https://github.com/puppetlabs/boltwash#installation-and-configuration)
