# On macOS

If using iTerm2, we recommend installing [iTerm2's shell integration](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) to avoid [issue#84](https://github.com/puppetlabs/wash/issues/84).

If the Wash daemon exits with a exit status of 255, that typically means that Wash couldn't load the FUSE extensions. MacOS only allows for a certain (small) number of virtual devices on the system, and if all available slots are taken up by other programs then we won't be able to run. You can view loaded extensions with `kextstat`. More information in [this github issue for *FUSE for macOS*](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/358).
