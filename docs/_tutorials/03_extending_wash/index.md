External plugins let Wash talk to other things outside of the shipped plugins. They can be written in any language. In fact, several external plugins have already been written by community members. If you want to try them out, then see the [external plugin docs]({{ '../../docs/external-plugins' }}) for notes on how to add them to Wash. If youâ€™re interested in writing your own external plugin, then please continue on with the [rest of the tutorial](writing-an-external-plugin).
